# Python-tools-to-analyse-genetic-data
Python programs (and R programs) to retrieve, transform, analyse the mouse genes (text and numeric) stored in the online bioinformatics databases MGI, Ensembl, Uniprot and Unigene and to validate the ids of the genes. Each program is a data analysis tool. After processing data using the tools, the processed data can be used to train machine learning classifiers such as random forest and SVM for predicting the essentialities of the genes.
